🚧 **INTERACTION KIT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS NOT READY FOR USE** 🏗

Interaction Kit is a framework for creating Discord slash command bots over the HTTP API.

<!-- ## HTTP vs Gateway

In short, you probably should be using [discord.js]() unless you know why you're here.

**Gateway**:

**HTTP**:

Interaction Kit **does not** interface with the Gateway, which limits information is available to your application (and also means you can never be sure the information you have is up to date - if you request information about a User, and that user then updates their profile, if you are on Gateway you'll get a notification of the update event. With the HTTP API, you would not know the data had been changed).

There are other drawbacks as well - HTTP-only bots don't currently show up as Online in a Guild's member list, which will lead to a lot of questions about whether the application is working or not.
