# Flint

This is the test application for Interaction Kit development.

## Usage

First create a new bot and add it to your development server. Then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values.

## Running the bot

To start the bot, run the following command at the root of Interaction Kit:

```bash
npm run bot
```

This command will automatically build all the necesary packages to run, but it will not spawn a watcher yet. If you make changes to Interaction Kit packages, you'll need to rerun the command.
